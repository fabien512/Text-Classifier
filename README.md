Machine Learning Text-Classifier
===============

Classify a sentence into a category using Naive Bayes Algorithm.
The algorithm gives a probability for each category using four different categories. 
Each of them contains around 50 elements for training set.
You need to add the jar weka.jar for the implementation of this algorithm.
